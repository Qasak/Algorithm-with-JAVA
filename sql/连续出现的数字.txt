-- Lag和Lead函数可以在同一次查询中取出同一字段的前N行的数据(Lag)和后N行的数据(Lead)作为独立的列
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums  from
(
    select num,lead(num,1)over()as num1,lead(num,2)over()as num2 
    from logs
) as c
where c.num = c.num1 and c.num1 = c.num2

-- 方法：用 DISTINCT 和 WHERE 语句

select distinct a.Num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs as a,
   Logs as b,
   Logs as c
 where a.Id = b.Id - 1
   and b.Id = c.Id - 1
   and a.Num = b.Num
   and b.Num = c.Num;
